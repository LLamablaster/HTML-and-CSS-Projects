# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository is for my Tech Academy HTML and CSS course projects.

### Basic Assignments
There are a number of assignments displaying basic use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
These include those found in the Basic_HTML_and_CSS and Basic_HTML_and_JavaScript_1 folders.

This simple website utilizes the Bootstrap framework.

The capstone project of the HTML and CSS course, where I was tasked with constructing my own
portfolio website from scratch using everything I learned in the course.
